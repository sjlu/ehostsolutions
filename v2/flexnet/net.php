	All of our servers are located at ThePlanet who operates two state-of-the-art data centers in Dallas, Texas, offering complete redundancy in power, HVAC, fire suppression, network connectivity, and security. The facility sits atop multiple power grids driven by TXU electric, with PowerWare UPS battery backup power and dual diesel generators onsite. The HVAC systems are condenser units by Data Aire to provide redundancy in cooling coupled with ten managed backbone providers. Twelve more third party backbone providers are available in the building via cross connect. Fire suppression includes a pre-action dry pipe system including VESDA (Very Early Smoke Detection Apparatus) with over 700 smoke detectors between the two facilities.<br>
